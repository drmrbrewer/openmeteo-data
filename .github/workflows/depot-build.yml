# note: could also use a more direct approach based on the depot CLI, which is more like that used for the depot-bitbucket integration
# and also more similar to the native `docker buildx build` CLI (in fact they've deliberately set it up to accept the same CLI options):
# CLI approach for Bitbucket (docker build): https://depot.dev/docs/integrations/bitbucket-pipelines#basic-build-and-push-to-dockerhub
# CLI approach for GitHub (generic): https://depot.dev/docs/integrations/github-actions#option-3--depot-cli
